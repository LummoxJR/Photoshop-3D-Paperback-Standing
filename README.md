# Photoshop-3D-Paperback-Standing

This script lets you turn a book cover file into a 3D image of a book using Photoshop or Photoshop Elements. Just follow these steps:

1) Open a flattened copy of your cover image in Photoshop or Elements.

2) Open this script file, or a copy of it, in a text editor to specify the book's width in inches, amount of bleed in the image, whether the spine and back cover are included, and other details.

3) Open the script file in Photoshop/Elements.

The resulting image will have layers for each of the visible faces of the book, a shadow, and a simple backdrop.

I release this script into the public domain to modify or copy as you see fit. If you have any suggestions or make interesting changes, please let me know; I'd love to see them. You can visit my blog at https://supervillainsomeday.wordpress.com.
